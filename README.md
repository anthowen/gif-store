I often find telegram stickers very funny and interesting, and sometimes want to use it in slack. The whole idea is to have the online collection of telegram stickers, so that I can use them in slack with just links.

This [website](https://gif-store.netlify.app) has the collection of telegram sticker gifs which are stored in the Google drive, and make you able to copy the links, and spend! 

Hope you find this useful and intersting, and feel free to add your own gifs by submitting PR!
